    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

Problem
Traditional image editing tools are limited in multimodal interactivity, making complex graphic manipulations cumbersome for non-experts.

Solution
We developed a multimodal LLM-based chat interface that enables intuitive image manipulation using text, speech, and gesture inputs. The interface includes a Chat Interface (text/speech) and a Gesture Interface (painting and direct manipulation) to support global, local, and object-level editing tasks.

Tech Stack
Models: InstructPix2Pix, Stable Diffusion Inpainting, Dragon Diffusion, OpenAI Whisper (Speech-to-Text), GPT-4

Frontend: React.js, use-gesture, Fabric.js

Backend: Python, FastAPI, HuggingFace Inference API

Results
Enabled seamless image editing through multimodal interaction.

Supported granular tasks like resize, move, and remove via gesture input.

Achieved real-time feedback with continuous editing loops.

Simplified complex graphic tasks, improving accessibility for non-designers.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images. -->

<!-- 
The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above: -->

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
